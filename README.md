This is an attempt to create an interactive version of the Standard Behavioral Index, which is described in a book called
The Standard Theory of Psychology by Damon Rose. This code was written by prompting AI to create an interactive version
of the Standard Behavioral Index by combining the monogram icon with the table version of the Behavioral Index. I have no
idea how to code so if someone wants to improve on this by moving the information of each thinking type to the appropriate
place so the information shows up in individual parts based on the area of the monogram that is being clicked or hovered,
I would really appreciate it. I will work on learning how to make that happen as time goes on but this is what I have so far.
